					<h2 class="testimonial">Merrit and Lois Kinsey</h2>
					<p>"We purchased our system from Ablaze Energy and are very pleased with the installation. The installation crew was good at keeping us posted on their progress and cleaned up very well after installation work. The system is so well hidden, it is invisible from the street, which we believe is a real asset to our "curb appeal." We have recommended Ablaze to several of our neighbors. Going 'Green' is the right thing to do, and Ablaze Energy seems to be the right company with which to work."</p>

					<h2 class="testimonial">Keith Sullivan</h2>
					<p>"I was contacted about the benefits of solar, and a quick analysis was done on my property. A few days later an official proposal was presented. It was obvious we could benefit from the product, and we signed on the line. A few weeks later a very professional crew began work and one week later it was complete. Xcel Energy showed up a few days later and we were up and running. The process was quick and effortless on my part, and all involved did a great job."</p>

					<h2 class="testimonial">Gene Grams</h2>
					<p>"From start to finish everyone involved was completely knowledgeable and professional. One would be hard-pressed to find a better installation crew; they were truly impressive. The money spent on this system will give us a payback that is unachievable with most current investments. Ablaze Energy definitely has my highest recommendation."</p>
