		<p><span>The basis for the SESEZ program</span> is a clear and comprehensive understanding of the Liberian context for private sector development and delivering socio-economic development goals. In its inception phase, the program focused on identifying the social and economic development objectives and obstacles identified by stakeholders across socio-economic and political scales; not only to align the program with government initiatives and greater consensus but also to verify the validity of existing development policies and agendas.</p>
		<p>In collecting this data the SESEZ program formulated a clear picture of what the most pressing social and economic development goals are, what obstacles hinder their attainment, and how the private sector has a role to play in addressing them. On a secondary level, we identified and examined the obstacles that hinder private sector growth for firms both big and small.</p>
		<p>These research questions informed the two primary objectives of the SESEZ program; overcoming obstacles to private sector growth, and delivering on the social and economic development needs identified by stakeholders in the Liberian context.</p>

				<h4>Is it just an SEZ for social enterprises?</h4>
			</a>	
			<div class="answer collapse" id="accordion1">
			  <p>Not quite… In Liberia, we’ve worked with social entrepreneurs, policy makers, Liberian business associations, commerce groups, and the general public to formulate a definition for social enterprise, and embedded the Liberian social enterprise model in our SEZ framework. In this way, the SESEZ is not just an SEZ offering space exclusively to social enterprises, but an SEZ that focuses on delivering social enterprise objectives through its own operation and policy agenda.</p>

				<h4>What is Social Enterprise in Liberia?</h4>
			</a>	
			<div class="answer collapse" id="accordion2">
				<p>Lets start from the very basic idea that a social enterprise is a private sector-driven approach to delivering socio-economic/environmental developments. This is the starting point from which local and international stakeholders began to define what social enterprise means in the Liberian context. In Liberia the private sector is seen as delivering on socio-economic development needs by: providing fair/scalable employment, and closing market gaps that hinder growth within key productive sectors; such as the lack of cold storage or a packaging and labeling plant. Although a cannery might not initially come to mind when you hear the term social enterprise, in Liberia, a cannery would drastically reduce post-harvest losses, generate greater profits for small holder farmers, improve food security, provide manufacturing jobs, reduce import dependence, allow for diversification of exports; generate impact far beyond revenue generation. </p>
				<p>Our goal with the establishment of Liberia’s first SESEZ, therefore, is to 1) provide an improved investment and doing business climate, by creating an industrial space with an autonomous and enabling policy environment that facilitates investment and inclusive private sector growth, 2) attract firms who’s operations inherently contribute to broader socio-economic development in the country.</p>
				<p>Adopting an SEZ approach facilitates the opportunity for creating conditions for investors, laborers, and entrepreneurs that are better than what can be found urrently at the national scale. In this way, the SESEZ will address many of the obstacles identified by stakeholders in Liberia’s private sector. </p>
				<p>However, even the most liberal private sector policies in the world cannot guarantee success and inclusive growth. To succeed in this right, we believe its critical to focus on developing sectors and industries with the greatest potential to become competitive regionally and globally. </p>
				<p>To determine what sectors would make up this strategy we formulated a deep understanding of the Liberian social, economic, physical, and historic landscapes. What has Liberian done well in the past and what does Liberia well today? What is available in abundance? Where can Liberia offer competitive pricing relative to the global market?  What advantages does Liberia’s geographic location provide? Which industries and trading partners benefit from existing policies? Which industries offer long term environmental, social, and economic sustainability? Which sectors offer the greatest opportunity for borad-based inclusion of the Liberian populace? These are all questions we asked to determine which sectors are capable of sustainably generating the greatest social impact and economic returns in Liberia.</p>
				<p>These are the industries, that if given a little push, can generate inclusive economic growth by offering globally competitive production and cost-efficiency in the long-term. In focusing on comparative advantages relative to the labor market, natural environment, regional and global position, the SESEZ program identifies what is needed to target those comparative advantages and transform them into competitive industries.</p>

				<h4>What does the SESEZ provide?</h4>
			</a>		
			<div class="answer collapse" id="accordion3">
				<p>The SESEZ will facilitate the required upgrades in infrastructure and policy in order to develop competitive industries over the long-term. From reliable utilities and green energy, to transparent regulatory regimes and expedited customs clearance, the SESEZ focuses on delivering a globally competitive industrial space with enabling and ethical policies. The benefits of operating inside the SESEZ translate to impact well beyond the gates of the zone by facilitating the growth of those Industries which have the greatest ability to generate the inclusive economic development, create jobs for thousands of people both inside and outside the zone, and provide the conditions for social and economic development through fair employment conditions and wages, and developing human capital capacity to maximize participation in formal economic activity.</p>
				<p>On another level, the SESEZ will, itself, deliver on social and economic development needs. Not only by enforcing fair working conditions and wages, but through attracting tenants who are attuned to the long-term success of the country; companies committed to making Liberia competitive in the long-term. The SESEZ can support these socially conscious ventures through our network of social impact investors, grant and donor opportunities; many of whom are interested in engaging in private sector development and investment, but reluctant given the existing policy and infrastructure environment. The SESEZ inspires the confidence to bring the partners to the table; creating an enabling policy environment, providing the utmost transparency and standards for business regulation. And finally, the SESEZ program offers a development and revitalization program for the community where it is located. Engaging with stakeholders at the community level, the SESEZ program identifies the needs of community members, groups, and leaders. Whether its providing housing and hospitals for tenant employees and their families, or renovating a school which serves the entire community, the SESEZ program is committed to delivering on the needs of the community by engaging with stakeholders at every level of society.</p>
