					<h4>Why develop a Special Economic Zone?</h4>
				<div class="answer collapse" id="what1">
				  <p>By using developing a Special Economic Zone we can create conditions for investors, laborers, and entrepreneurs that boost the doing business climate. In this way, we can address many of the obstacles identified in Liberia’s private sector. Additionally, we believe it's critical to focus on developing sectors and industries with the greatest potential to become competitive regionally and globally.</p>

					<h4>What does the SESEZ program want to achieve?</h4>
				<div class="answer collapse" id="what2">
					<p>The objective of Liberia’s first SESEZ is to 1) develop an improved investment and doing business climate, in an industrial space that supports investment and inclusive private sector growth, and 2) attract local and international companies who’s operations inherently contribute to socio-economic development in Liberia.</p>

					<h4>What does a Social Enterprise in Liberia mean?</h4>
				<div class="answer collapse" id="what3">
					<p>A social enterprise is a private sector-driven approach to delivering socio-economic and environmental objectives. This was the starting point for local and international stakeholders to define what a social enterprise means in Liberia. In Liberia the private sector is seen as contributing to socio-economic development by:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Providing fair & scalable employment.</li>
						<li>Closing market gaps that hinder growth within key sectors; such as the lack of cold storage or a packaging and labeling plant.</li>							
					</ul>
					<p>Although a cannery might not initially come to mind when you hear the term social enterprise, in Liberia, a cannery would drastically reduce post-harvest losses, generate greater profits for farmers, improve food security, provide manufacturing jobs, reduce import dependence, allow for diversification of exports and generate impact far beyond revenue generation.</p>

				<a class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" href="#what4" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">
					<h4>Is it just an SEZ for Social Enterprises?</h4>
				<div class="answer collapse" id="what4">
				  <p>Not quite... in Liberia, we’ve worked with entrepreneurs, policy makers, Liberian business associations, commerce groups, and the public to define the concept of a social enterprise. We created a broad local consensus around the concept of social enterprise, and inserted this in our program. In doing so, we are making sure the SESEZ is not just a space exclusively for social enterprises but an SEZ that delivers social impact through its operation and policies.</p>

				<a class="collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" href="#what5" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">
					<h4>What is the basis for the Liberian SESEZ program?</h4>
				<div class="answer collapse" id="what5">
				  <p>To develop a strong SESEZ program, a clear understanding of private sector development in Liberia and delivering socio-economic impact was needed. At first, the program focused on identifying the social and economic concerns identified by all stakeholders involved. This was done to align the program with national goals, to create consensus and confirm the need for specific socio-economic impact.</p>
				  <p>In collecting this data the SESEZ program formulated a clear picture of what the most pressing social and economic development goals are, what obstacles hinder their attainment, and how the private sector has a role to play in addressing them. On a secondary level, we identified and examined the obstacles that hinder private sector growth for firms both big and small.</p>

					<h4>How do companies benefit from the SESEZ?</h4>	
				<div class="answer collapse" id="how1">
					<p>The SESEZ delivers a globally competitive industrial space for socially conscious companies through:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Our network of social impact investors, grant and donor opportunities; many of whom are interested in engaging in private sector development and investment.</li>
						<li>Creating an enabling policy environment, providing the highest transparency standards for business and expedited customs clearance.</li>

				<div class="answer collapse" id="how2">
					<p>The SESEZ delivers social and economic development by providing fair working conditions and wages, and through attracting companies who are focused on the long-term success of Liberia. The benefits of operating inside the SESEZ translate to impact well beyond the gates of the zone by:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Stimulating growth of Liberian industries that have the greatest ability to generate inclusive economic development.</li>
						<li>Creating jobs for thousands of people both inside and outside the zone, and providing fair employment and wages.</li>

					<h4>How to determine what industries to focus on?</h4>	
				<div class="answer collapse" id="how3">
					<p>These are the industries that if given a little push, can generate inclusive economic growth by offering globally competitive production in the long-term. To determine this we worked on a detailed understanding of Liberia's social, economic, physical, and historic aspects. Questions were asked like: What has Liberia done well in the past and what does Liberia well today? What is available in abundance? Where can Liberia be competitive? What advantages does Liberia’s geographic location provide? Which industries and trading partners benefit from existing policies? What industries offer long-term environmental, social, and economic sustainability? Which sectors offer the greatest opportunity for broad-based inclusion?</p>

					<h4>How does the SESEZ collaborate with the surrounding community?</h4>				
				<div class="answer collapse" id="how4">
					<p>The SESEZ program offers development and revitalization for the community where it is located. In working with the community, the SESEZ program will focus on its specific needs. Whether its providing housing and hospitals for company employees and their families, or renovating a school which serves the community, the SESEZ program is committed to delivering on the needs of the community at every level of the Liberian society.</p>
